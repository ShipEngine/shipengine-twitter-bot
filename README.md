@ShipEngineBot
============================
## A Twitter bot that answers natural language questions about shipping

[@ShipEngineBot](https://twitter.com/ShipEngineBot/with_replies) is a Twitter bot that's written in Node.js.  It uses ShipEngine's [shipping rates API](https://docs.shipengine.com/docs/get-shipping-rates), Yelp's [business search API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3/business_search), and Twitter's [stream API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/consuming-streaming-data) to answer natural language questions about shipping packages.

### A few examples
These are the kinds of questions that you can ask @ShipEngineBot:

> Hey @ShipEngineBot, I need to send 20 pounds of gummy bears from Austin to Portland. What'll that cost me?

> @ShipEngineBot, How much does it cost to send a 4oz letter from New Jersey to Paris?

> I wonder if @ShipEngineBot can help me ship 5kg of potato chips to 78702 from 90210

> @ShipEngineBot Can you help me send a package from Denver to Orlando? It weighs 4 pounds.
